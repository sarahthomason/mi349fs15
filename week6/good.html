<h2>Chunking is Good</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is a good example of web design that does takes proper care of chunking, in which information is separated.  Information should be broken down into sections, and the eye should travel a page quickly to find what they need.  Use of headers, and spacing will help.  So, <b>chunk your information, then chunk it more.</b>  That's the key to organization.</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of, we chunk while coding as well, don't we?  We probably could code the entirety of a webpage in one long hideous line.  That would be very difficult to debug or change though, and even worse for someone else who never wrote the code in the first place!</p>

<h2>Did You Know</h2>
<hr>
<p>Did you know if you begin to type "lor" in Atom, you are given the option just be pressing "enter" to have the "Lorem Ipsum" dummy text page filling automatically?  Amazing.  I don't have even google it and copy and paste it!  And it looks a lot better than me running my hands over the keys.</p>
