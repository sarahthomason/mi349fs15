(Bad Example)</h1>

<p>This is a bad example of web design that does not take proper care of chunking, in which information is lumped together all at once.  There is no header, no separation in the paragraphs, there is not much in terms of contrast, making it hard to determine the header from the body.  I've found a couple of older webpages, that make the mistake of writing as if for a book rather than a webpage, and so their paragraphs and sentences look like long blocks of text- cluttered, and hard to read.  Readers will have a hard time scanning the page for the information they need.  Information should be broken down into sections, and the eye should travel a page quickly to find what they need.  The rest of the this page is going to be a copy of the standard page filler, "Lorem ipsum," because I don't think I have it in me to write a whole essay on this subject, though I think I've made my point well enough.  Chunk your information, then chunk it more.  That's the key to organization, always.  It makes it easier to find things, for the reader, and probably the designer later on as well should they need to fix it.  Hey, speaking of, we chunk while coding as well, don't we?  We probably could technically code the entirety of a webpage in one long hideous line.  That would drive me insane though...

Wow, even after one Lorem Ipsum, this page still doesn't look nearly as filled as the "good page."  I guess when you cram stuff together it does mean there's more you can do with a space.  Not that that's necessarily a good thing.  Information overload, am I right?  Anyway, here's more page filling!
