      <h1>The Story</h1>
      <section><p>Amnesia: Memories is a story of a girl who loses her memories one day when a spirit child known as Orion accidentally collides with her, rendering her amnesiac and himself trapped within her body.  To seperate, they must rediscover what the heroine has forgotten, without alerting friends, family, and co-workers of her issue, else she lands in a hospital with no hope of regaining her lost memories, with Orion trapped within.  But who can she trust with no memories to know otherwise?  Whose lying to her, taking advantage of her, out to get her?</p>
      <p>Depending on the route you take, your story will play out immensely different from another.  For example, Shin's route plays out more like a crime drama of "Clue" whereas Kent's route plays out as a mild romantic comedy.  The game has a little something for everyone!</p></section>

      <h1>Playing The Game</h1>
      <section><p>Amnesia: Memories is an otome game.  Otome games are games marketed to young women.  They're visual novels with elements of romance, almost akin to a dating sim.  The game is played by making choices that affect your parameters ("trust," "affection," "suspicion," and "doubt") to get various endings, good, neutral, and many, many bad endings.  </p>
      <p>The choice of world you choose in the prologue determines the route you will start.  It's a much quicker set up than other otome games which require you to play a "common" bunch of chapters before the story diverges based on your choices.  In Amnesia, your choice in world, from the very beginning, already makes a difference in the story you'll be reading. </p>
      <p>Feeling overwhelmed and not sure of what choice to make?  Read my reviews to get a glimpse (no spoilers present) of what you'll be getting into.  </p>
      <p>Afterwards, feel free to use the walkthroughs to help you obtain the ending you'd like to see!  Quick walkthroughs will provide you with all the answers you need to get to the ending you'd like.  An in-depth walkthrough will provide you with all the answers, what parameters they affect, and explanations about key points within the game such as ways to unlock all the images for your gallery.</p></section>
