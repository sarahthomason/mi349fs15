  <h2>THE LONG PITCH</h2>
  <article>
		<p>Game walkthroughs for visual novels are often either long, wordy undecorated text documents that require the "find" search function to navigate through or oversimplified answer sheets that do not give its readers enough information to be a little more free in their choices.</p>
		<p>The goal of the website and walkthrough is to provide comprehensive information regarding the various stat changes and event triggers made by every choice in the game, and provide explanations on how to reach all endings- allowing the player to be more free in their choices.  This will all be easily navigable through an ever-present menu.  Despite there being so much information, it will be organized into sections, given color, and will make use of bold and italics for easier comprehension.  All this should provide for easy viewing on mobile devices.</p>
